# Employee-Directory
    
## Description
    
This application is an employee directory to quickly access information on a list of personnel. Users can view the entire employee directory, or can filter by name to search for certain employees. Users can also sort employees in either ascending or descending alphabetical order.

This application is built using React. The application's UI is broken into components, and these components have managed states. They also respond to the user events above (i.e. filtering, sorting).

This application is deployed to GitHub Pages (see [Usage](#usage) tab for link).
